# Find a Function

Find a Function is a function visualizer, as well as a function finder. If you want to know a function that has some points in it or you just want to play with functions, Find a Function can do that. You can visualize different functions and calculate the best fit curve.

# How to use it

Put some points on the plain by entering the coordinates in the top row fields. These are your data points that you'll fit your curve into. Once you have placed the points, you can just "Start the Find". You'll see the top functions that have the minimun error.
